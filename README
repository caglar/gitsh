gitsh is a simple git shell for interactive git commands. This is a product of my weekend 1 hour project.
With the help of gitsh, you can run git commands without adding git before it. I know, it is not such a big
innovation; but it is very useful if you write many git commands consecutively. You can also do
more thung with less typing. That way is more intuitive and expressive for me. You can also run
chained commands and run them consecutively from command line as well.
It has two use cases:
1)Using git shell:
This is just like a typical interactive shell like mysql's or cpan's.
Ex:
gitsh> add .                                                                                                                                                                        
gitsh> commit -m "added README"

 1 files changed, 11 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)                                                                                                                                  
 create mode 100644 README                                                                                                                                                          
gitsh> exit 
2)Running commands consecutively from command line:

You can write several git commands with -e parameter and seperating each command with semicolon. Ex:
gitsh -e add -A; commit -m "Lorem ipsulum"
